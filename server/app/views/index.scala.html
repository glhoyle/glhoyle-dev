      <h3>About Me</h3>
      <p>
        My name is Gracen Hoyle, and I am a junior at Trinity University in San Antonio, Texas.
        I am a computer science major and a classical studies minor, with an interest in game development and
        web applications.
        <br><br>
        In my spare time, I enjoy playing video games and creating digital and traditional art.
        I firmly believe that technical knowledge and creativity go hand in hand, and that computer science is an
        inherently artistic field focused on the creation of software and content. I'm also very interested in the field
        of virtual reality and the potential it holds, both for creating fiction and helping people explore the world
        around them.
      </p>
      <h3>Notable Experience</h3>
      <p>
        I have a few roles while I'm on campus. I work as a marketing intern in Trinity's Center for Experiental
        Learning and Career Success, helping to advertise events and seminars hosted by the office. This coming semester,
        I will be working at the campus newspaper, the Trinitonian, as a graphic designer and web assistant.
        In the past semester, I worked as a peer tutor for the Trinity chapter of the Association for Computer Machinery
        tutoring first-year computer science students.
        <br><br>
        This past summer, I worked as a marketing intern at Filestack in San Antonio. I did search engine optimization and
        some web development in Javascript, creating a new chatbot for the Filestack website in HubSpot as well as designing and coding
        a Zoom background generator to take existing photos and modify them for use in Zoom.
        <br><br>
        I have an interest in game development, with many of my past projects being gamified in some way. This coming Fall semester, 2020, I will
        be taking a game development class in order to hopefully expand my ability to code in C#, as well as in developing independent
        game projects.
