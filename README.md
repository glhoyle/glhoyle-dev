Code for my personal website. Created by Gracen Hoyle, 2020.

This is a basic one-page web application created using HTML/CSS and ScalaJS, written using the Play framework and hosted on a Heroku webserver.
I like to utilize "basic" tools for web development, as I find HTML/CSS to be fun to use for creative projects.

This website is ever-evolving, updated as I can and want to improve it.
